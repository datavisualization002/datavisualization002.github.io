This website is a learning log organized around examples. For each example, I embed a data visualization created in Flourish, describe the underlying data structure, and record notes about the current setup and key decisions. If a visualization requires a specific tool or a more detailed explanation, I include that information in the **Notes** section.
### Naming
For each item in the gallery, I name it either (1) in a straightforward way (e.g., _Custom Map_) or (2) using a **variable + time + dimension** format. For example, **Continuous–Year–Geography** means the visualization presents trends in a continuous variable over time, grouped by geography. The “geography” can refer to real map, or to a grid layout that represents relative geographic relationships.
### What’s included
This website does not provide a complete beginner tutorial for Flourish. It is intended for users who already have some experience with basic data visualization. Since this is a learning log, I will continue adding new examples, notes, and tools as I learn.
